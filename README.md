# Project Overview

For this project, I'll be building a portfolio website. I will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and I replicate that design in HTML and CSS. I will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects I will complete through the course of I Nanodegree program. 

# Language used: HTML, CSS
